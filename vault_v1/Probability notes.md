# Calculation of Probability 1 
*taken from the books A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics by Dekken and co, and Introduction to Probability by Blitzstein and Hwang*
Note: when referencing to pages, I refer to the page on the pdf of each book.
## 1.2 Sample spaces and Pebble World (Blitzstein)
*this is complementary to my course in college*
4. Let D be the event that there were at least two consecutive Heads. As a set,
	$$ D = \bigcup_{j=1}^{9}(A_{j}\cap A_{j+1})$$
	So two consecutive *anything* is the intersection of: $$ i\cap i_{++}$$
*page 23:* In fact, the counting methods introduced later in this chapter show that there are $$2^{52} \approx 4.5 \times 10^{15} $$ events in this problem, even though there are only 52 pebbles.This is the algebra of the sample space? 
*Page 25:* A good strategy when trying to find the probability of an event is to start by thinking about whether it will be easier to find the probability of the event or the probability of its complement
