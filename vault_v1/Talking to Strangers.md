#book by Malcom Gladwell (writer of Outliers)
# Introducción

Durante la historia, los conflictos raramente han sido entre extraños (strangers). La gran excepción a esto ha sido la conquista española, pero incluso en este caso los tlaxcaltecas atacaron a sus vecinos. El mundo es como esa interacción, entre Cortés y Moctezuma tratando de entenderse a pesar de tener una historia completamente diferente. Es por esto que escribió el libro, del porque somos tan malos en el acto de traducción. Cada capítulo tocara un elemento de porque. 

# Part One. Spies and Diplomats: Two Puzzles

## Chapter One. Fidel Castro Revenge

Florentino Aspillaga quería salir de Cuba con una bombota, así que se fue a Estados Unidos a decirles a los gringos los nombres de las personas que el conocía, y resultó que todas esas personas eran doble agentes de la CIA, sin embargo, estaban dando información falsa a los gringos, cosa que Fidel Castro dirigió, y finalmente lanzó un documental en el que se burlan de los agentes de la CIA.

Puzzle Number One: Why can’t we tell when the stranger in front of us is lying to our face?:

## Chapter Two. Getting to Know der Führer

Neville Chamberlain quería conocer a Hitler en 1938, ya que ningún alto oficial de los aliados lo había conocido. Cuando lo conoció pensó que no quería ir a una guerra. En general todos los que estuvieron con Hitler pensaron que no quería ir a una guerra, evidentemente estaban mal, y todos los que no lo conocieron pensaban lo correcto. Todos creemos entender a alguien cuando los vemos a los ojos y juzgamos, pero Chamberlain y Halafax hicieron eso con Hitler y salieron con una impresión completamente errónea. 

Puzzle Number Two: How is it that meeting a stranger can sometimes make us worse at making sense of that person than not meeting them?

“We have, in other words, CIA officers who cannot make sense of their spies, judges who cannot make sense of their defendants, and prime ministers who cannot make sense of their adversaries. We have people struggling with their first impressions of a stranger. We have people struggling when they have months to understand a stranger. We have people struggling when they meet with someone only once, and people struggling when they return to the stranger again and again. They struggle with assessing a stranger’s honesty. They struggle with a stranger’s character. They struggle with a stranger’s intent. It’s a mess.”

Los desconocidos (strangers) no son fáciles. 

# Part Two. Default to Truth

## Chapter Three. The Queen of Cuba 

“The issue with spies is not that there is something brilliant about them. It is that there is something wrong with us."

Somos pésimos detectando mentiras porque: “We do not behave, in other words, like sober-minded scientists, slowly gathering evidence of the truth or falsity of something before reaching a conclusion. We do the opposite. We start by believing. And we stop believing only when our doubts and misgivings rise to the point where we can no longer explain them away.”

We default to truth.

Le crees a alguien porque no tienes las suficientes dudas sobre ellos. 

## Chapter Four. The Holy Fool 

“Tim Levine reminds us, lies are rare. And those lies that are told are told by a very small subset of people. That’s why it doesn’t matter so much that we are terrible at detecting lies in real life. Under the circumstances, in fact, defaulting to truth makes logical sense. If the person behind the counter at the coffee shop says your total with tax is $6.74, you can do the math yourself to double-check their calculations, holding up the line and wasting thirty seconds of your time. Or you can simply assume the salesperson is telling you the truth, because on balance most people do tell the truth.”

## Chapter Five. The Boy in the Shower

“...doubts are not the enemy of belief; they are its companion.”

“Default to truth becomes an issue when we are forced to choose between two alternatives, one of which is likely and the other of which is impossible to imagine”

“Default to truth biases us in favor of the most likely interpretation.”

“We think we want our guardians to be alert to every suspicion. We blame them when they default to truth. When we try to send people like Graham Spanier to jail, we send a message to all of those in positions of authority about the way we want them to make sense of strangers—without stopping to consider the consequences of sending that message.”

# Part Three: Transparency

## Chapter Three. The Friends Fallacy

“Transparency is the idea that people’s behavior and demeanor—the way they represent themselves on the outside—provides an authentic and reliable window into the way they feel on the inside. It is the second of the crucial tools we use to make sense of strangers. When we don’t know someone, or can’t communicate with them, or don’t have the time to understand them properly, we believe we can make sense of them through their behavior and demeanor.”

“Transparency is the idea that people’s behavior and demeanor—the way they represent themselves on the outside—provides an authentic and reliable window into the way they feel on the inside. It is the second of the crucial tools we use to make sense of strangers. When we don’t know someone, or can’t communicate with them, or don’t have the time to understand them properly, we believe we can make sense of them through their behavior and demeanor.”

“If real life were like Friends, judges would beat computers. But they don’t. So maybe real life isn’t like Friends.”

“I don’t think that this mistake—expecting what is happening on the outside to perfectly match what is going on inside—matters with our friends. Part of what it means to get to know someone is to come to understand how idiosyncratic their emotional expressions can be”

“This is the explanation for the second of the puzzles, in Chapter Two, about why computers do a much better job than judges at making bail decisions. The computer can’t see the defendant. Judges can, and it seems logical that that extra bit of information ought to make them better decision-makers”

“Some years ago there was a famous case in Texas in which a young man named Patrick Dale Walker put a gun to his ex-girlfriend’s head—only to have the gun jam as he pulled the trigger. The judge in his case set bail at $1 million, then lowered it to $25,000 after Walker had spent four days in jail, on the grounds that this was long enough for him to “cool off.” Walker, the judge explained later, had nothing on his record, “not even a traffic ticket.” He was polite: “He was a real low-key, mild-mannered young man. The kid, from what I understand, is a real smart kid. He was valedictorian of his class. He graduated from college. This was supposedly his first girlfriend.” Most important, according to the judge, Walker showed remorse.         
The judge thought Walker was transparent. But what does “showed remorse” mean? Did he put on a sad face, cast his eyes down, and lower his head, the way he had seen people show remorse on a thousand television shows? And why do we think that if someone puts on a sad face, casts their eyes down, and lowers their head, then some kind of sea change has taken place in their heart? Life is not like Friends. Seeing Walker didn't help the judge. It hurt him. It allowed him to explain away the simple fact that Walker had put a gun to his girlfriend's head and failed to killed her only because the gun misfired. Four months later, while out on bail, Walker shot his girlfriend to death.”

## Chapter Seven. A Short of Explanation of Amanda Knox Case

“ We think liars in real life behave like liars would on Friends—telegraphing their internal states with squirming and darting eyes. This is—to put it mildly—nonsense. Liars don’t look away”

“When a liar acts like an honest person, though, or when an honest person acts like a liar, we’re flummoxed. Nervous Nelly is mismatched. She looks like she’s lying, but she’s not. She’s just nervous! In other words, human beings are not bad lie detectors. We are bad lie detectors in those situations when the person we’re judging is mismatched.”

**Knox:** “I think everyone’s reaction to something horrible is different."  
	Todas las personas tienen reacciones diferentes a cualquier tipo de escenario, y la gente debería saber que no tienes que comportarte de la manera que ellos esperan. 

## Chapter Eight. Case Study: The Fraternity Party

“Under the best of circumstances, lack of transparency makes the encounter between a man and a woman at a party a problematic event. So what happens when alcohol is added to the mix?”

“The myopia theory was first suggested by psychologists Claude Steele and Robert Josephs. Alcohol makes the thing in the foreground even more salient and the thing in the background less significant. It makes short-term considerations loom large, and more cognitively demanding, longer-term considerations fade away.”

“Drinking puts you at the mercy of your environment. It crowds out everything except the most immediate experiences.”

“Consent is something that two parties negotiate, on the assumption that each side in a negotiation is who they say they are. But how can you determine consent when, at the moment of negotiation, both parties are so far from their true selves?”

“The outcome of People v. Brock Turner brought a measure of justice to Emily Doe. But so long as we refuse to acknowledge what alcohol does to the interaction between strangers, that evening at Kappa Alpha will be repeated again. And again.”

# Part Four: Lessons

## Chapter Nine. KSM: What Happens When the Stranger is a Terrorist? 

**Summary (UTTP):** “Default to truth is a crucially important strategy that occasionally and unavoidably leads us astray. Transparency is a seemingly commonsense assumption that turns out to be an illusion. Both, however, raise the same question: once we accept our shortcomings, what should we do?”
