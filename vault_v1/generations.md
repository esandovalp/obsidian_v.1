Complete name of the book: Generations: The Real Differences Between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, Boomers, and Silents―and What They Mean for America's Future
## Chapter 1: The How and Why of Generations
- Page 4: “The era when you were born has a substantial influence on your behaviors, attitudes, values, and personality traits. In fact, when you were born has a larger effect on your personality and attitudes than the family who raised you does.”
- Page 5 (Sample size of the study): “In these pages, you’ll find the results of generational analyses spanning twenty-four datasets including thirty-nine million people—nearly as many people as live in California, the most populous state in the U.S. With so much data, it’s possible to get a better understanding of generational differences than ever before.”
- Page 7 (answers this book provides): “But hasn’t new technology affected all of us?” Or they’d want to know, “Do other generations also look different now from before?” This book is the answer to those questions”
- Page 8-9 (What Causes Generational Differences): 
	- Classic theory: the cause is major events 
		- She says that major events *can* certainly shape a generation, but misses the rest of cultural change 
	- Her theory: “So what is the root cause of these cultural changes—and thus the root cause of generational differences? It should be something that keeps progressing year after year, and something with a big impact on day-to-day life. The strongest candidate is technology." 
- Technology Model of Generations: “Technology and its aftereffects—on culture, behavior, and attitudes—have broken the old cycles of generations to form something novel. This model—let’s call it the Technology Model of Generations—is a new theory of generations for the modern world"
	- But...same sex marriage is not directly linked to technology. Or is it? (she says it is, but she'll eventually talk about this)
		- On page 13: “What does same-sex marriage have to do with technology? What about the shift from formal to casual clothing in the workplace? Both of these changes are rooted in technology’s daughter, individualism. Individualistic countries were the first to embrace equal rights for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people, while more collectivistic countries have not.”
		- So in short, the relation it has it's because of the *daughter* of Technolgy, individualism.

	- “Technology also contributes to many of the major events prized in classic generational theories. Consider airplanes, a key technological development of the 20th century. Airplanes played a role in at least four major events of the last one hundred years: World War II (where planes were used in combat, including dropping the first nuclear bomb), 9/11 (where planes were used as weapons), and the AIDS and COVID-19 pandemics (where both viruses spread via airplane travel).”
- General rule for the book: “Just because something has changed over the generations does not make it bad (or good). Often, it just is.”
- Goal of this book: “To separate the myths from the realities of generational differences so we can understand each other better.”
- “When someone says, “But I’m a Gen Z’er and I don’t spend much time online—so I don’t think there’s really a generational difference,” they are committing what some call the “NAXALT” fallacy, for “Not All X Are Like That.” The NAXALT fallacy is the mistaken belief that because someone in the group lies at the extreme, the average does not exist.”
- “Thus, generational change is not just about individual people changing; it’s about cultural norms shifting. ”
- Why older generations always complain on the younger ones: “With technology making life progressively less physically taxing for each generation, each generation is softer than the one before it.”
## Silents 
- Despite their name, they were never Silent. MLK and Judge Ruth are their most notable members. 
- “Some men see things as they are, and say why,” Robert F. Kennedy (b. 1925) said. “I dream of things that never were, and say why not.” Silents have seen things they never would have dreamed of when they were young, and their life trajectory from tradition to change reflects the transformation of American society since their midcentury youth.”
- They lead the 70's hippie movement (radical change)
- “Silents were at the forefront of the changes that created our modern vision of equality, especially around race, gender, and sexual orientation.”
- “In one national survey, 1 out of 12 White Americans in 2021 said they would oppose a close relative marrying a Black person, down from 2 out of 3 in the early 1990s”
	- 1 out of 12 is still crazy.
