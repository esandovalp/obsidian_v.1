## What is Cloud Storage

- **Think of it as a giant hard drive in the cloud.** Instead of storing files on your computer, Cloud Storage lets you keep them securely on Google's massive servers.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Accessibility:** Get your files from anywhere with an internet connection (phone, laptop, etc.).
    - **Scalability:** Store as much or as little as you want, no need to buy physical hard drives.
    - **Security:** Google handles security, protecting your data from threats.
    - **Collaboration:** Easily share files with others.
## What is a bucket?

- **Buckets are like folders for your Cloud Storage.** They're the basic way you organize your files and other data.
- **Key things about buckets:**
    - **Unique names:** Bucket names need to be unique across all of Google Cloud. It's like your special online storage folder address.
    - **Control access:** You set rules on who can view or change things in your bucket.
    - **Location:** You can choose where in the world your bucket is stored (important for speed and regulations).
## Why use Cloud Storage with buckets?

- **Storing different types of data:**
    - Website files
    - Backups of your computer or phone
    - Large datasets for analysis
    - Videos, photos, music... you name it!
- **Organizing big projects:** You might have a bucket for "marketing materials", another for "customer data", etc.
- **Keeping things secure:** Buckets let you manage access, so only the right people can see the right files.
- **Object retention** is a built-in option that lets you configure how long the files should remain without allowing any changes.
